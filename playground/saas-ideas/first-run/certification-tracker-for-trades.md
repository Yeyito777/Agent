### Prompt:
```md
You are a micro-SaaS market researcher. Your goal is to find ONE promising niche where I (a solo developer) could build a small software product charging $20-100/month and realistically reach $2k+/month in revenue.
```

## Recommended Niche: Certification & License Expiration Tracker for Small Trades Businesses

**Target customer:** Small contractor/trades companies (5-30 employees) — plumbers, electricians, HVAC, roofers, general contractors, cleaning services. The buyer is the owner or office manager who currently tracks everything in spreadsheets or their head.

### Why this niche

**The pain is real and expensive.** An expired contractor license means work stoppages, fines (often 50%+ late fees), inability to bid on jobs, and potential legal liability. Every trades business juggles dozens of expiring items: employee OSHA certs, trade-specific licenses, business licenses (state + local), insurance policies (GL, workers comp, auto), and vehicle/equipment inspections. Missing one can shut down a job site.

**The gap exists.** Current solutions are either:
- Enterprise-grade tools like TalentGuard or ComplianceQuest ($149-$500+/month, complex onboarding, built for HR departments)
- Generic expiration trackers like ExpirationReminder.com ($49-$499/month, not tailored to trades)
- Spreadsheets and calendar reminders (what most small operators actually use)

Nobody is building a simple, $39-79/month tool specifically for a 15-person plumbing company.

**Willingness to pay is high.** These businesses do $500K-$5M+ in revenue. $49/month is a rounding error compared to the cost of one expired cert shutting down a job site.

### What the product does

- Dashboard: "what's expiring in 30/60/90 days" at a glance
- Track employees' certifications, business licenses, insurance policies, vehicle inspections
- Automated email/SMS reminders (configurable: 90, 60, 30, 7 days before expiry)
- Document upload (photo of cert, PDF of insurance policy)
- Simple employee profiles with cert status
- Audit-ready export (for when a GC or inspector asks "show me your team's certs")

### Revenue math

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Price | $49/month |
| Target to hit $2K MRR | ~41 customers |
| US trades companies (5-50 employees) | ~700,000 |
| Penetration needed | 0.006% |

### How to find customers

1. **Google Ads** — "contractor license tracking software", "OSHA certification tracker" (low competition, high intent)
2. **Trade association directories** — NAHB, ABC, local contractor associations
3. **Facebook/Reddit groups** — contractor communities are very active
4. **Cold outreach to construction company office managers** — these people feel the pain daily
5. **Content SEO** — "how to track employee certifications", "[state] contractor license renewal requirements"

### Why you can win as a solo dev

- It's a standard CRUD app + reminder system + document storage — no complex algorithms
- The trades vertical has low expectations for flashy UI; they want something that *works* and is *simple*
- Once data is entered, switching costs are high (very sticky)
- No need for integrations on day 1 — these businesses don't have complex tech stacks
- You can build an MVP in 4-6 weeks and validate with 5 paying beta customers

### Validation steps (next 2 weeks)

1. Put up a landing page describing the problem and collect emails
2. Find 10 small contractors and do 15-minute problem interviews ("how do you track certifications today?")
3. Target: 20+ email signups and 3+ people saying "I'd pay for that today"

**Bottom line:** This is a boring, unglamorous tool solving a painful, expensive problem for businesses with real budgets. That's exactly the profile of micro-SaaS ideas that reach $2K+/month.
