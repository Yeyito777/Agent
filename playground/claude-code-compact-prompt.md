# Claude Code Default Compact Prompts

Extracted from the Claude Code binary via `strings` inspection.

There are two compaction prompts:
- **Full Compact (`sJD`)** — used for the first compaction when the entire conversation needs summarizing
- **Partial Compact (`tJD`)** — used for subsequent compactions when earlier context is retained and only recent messages need summarizing

After compaction, a **continuation message** (`qmH`) is prepended to the conversation.

## Full Compact Prompt (`sJD`)

```
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.
Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:
1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.
Your summary should include the following sections:
1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.
Here's an example of how your output should be structured:
<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>
<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   [Detailed description]
2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - [Concept 1]
   - [Concept 2]
   - [...]
3. Files and Code Sections:
   - [File Name 1]
      - [Summary of why this file is important]
      - [Summary of the changes made to this file, if any]
      - [Important Code Snippet]
   - [File Name 2]
      - [Important Code Snippet]
   - [...]
4. Errors and fixes:
    - [Detailed description of error 1]:
      - [How you fixed the error]
      - [User feedback on the error if any]
    - [...]
5. Problem Solving:
   [Description of solved problems and ongoing troubleshooting]
6. All user messages:
    - [Detailed non tool use user message]
    - [...]
7. Pending Tasks:
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]
   - [...]
8. Current Work:
   [Precise description of current work]
9. Optional Next Step:
   [Optional Next step to take]
</summary>
</example>
Please provide your summary based on the conversation so far, following this structure and ensuring precision and thoroughness in your response.
There may be additional summarization instructions provided in the included context. If so, remember to follow these instructions when creating the above summary. Examples of instructions include:
<example>
## Compact Instructions
When summarizing the conversation focus on typescript code changes and also remember the mistakes you made and how you fixed them.
</example>
<example>
# Summary instructions
When you are using compact - please focus on test output and code changes. Include file reads verbatim.
</example>
```

If custom instructions are provided (non-empty), the following is appended:

```
Additional Instructions:
${customInstructions}
```

And finally, this is always appended at the end:

```
IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any tools. You MUST respond with ONLY the <summary>...</summary> block as your text output.
```

## Partial Compact Prompt (`tJD`)

Used when earlier context is being retained and only recent messages need summarizing:

```
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the RECENT portion of the conversation — the messages that follow earlier retained context. The earlier messages are being kept intact and do NOT need to be summarized. Focus your summary on what was discussed, learned, and accomplished in the recent messages only.
Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:
1. Analyze the recent messages chronologically. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.
Your summary should include the following sections:
1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture the user's explicit requests and intents from the recent messages
2. Key Technical Concepts: List important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed recently.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List errors encountered and how they were fixed.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages from the recent portion that are not tool results.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks from the recent messages.
8. Current Work: Describe precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step related to the most recent work. Include direct quotes from the most recent conversation.
Here's an example of how your output should be structured:
<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>
<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   [Detailed description]
2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - [Concept 1]
   - [Concept 2]
3. Files and Code Sections:
   - [File Name 1]
      - [Summary of why this file is important]
      - [Important Code Snippet]
4. Errors and fixes:
    - [Error description]:
      - [How you fixed it]
5. Problem Solving:
   [Description]
6. All user messages:
    - [Detailed non tool use user message]
7. Pending Tasks:
   - [Task 1]
8. Current Work:
   [Precise description of current work]
9. Optional Next Step:
   [Optional Next step to take]
</summary>
</example>
Please provide your summary based on the RECENT messages only (after the retained earlier context), following this structure and ensuring precision and thoroughness in your response.
```

Same custom instructions and "IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any tools..." suffix is appended as with the full compact prompt.

## Post-Compaction Continuation Message (`qmH`)

After compaction, the summary is processed (analysis/summary tags are replaced with plain headers, excess newlines collapsed) and then injected into the conversation with this wrapper:

```
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.
${processedSummary}
If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: ${transcriptPath}
Recent messages are preserved verbatim.
```

If auto-continue is enabled, this line is appended:

```
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
```

---

## Notes

- The summary output is post-processed by `qs1`: `<analysis>` tags become `Analysis:` headers, `<summary>` tags become `Summary:` headers, and consecutive blank lines are collapsed.
- There's a duplicate numbering bug in the full compact prompt: section 6 appears twice ("All user messages" and "Pending Tasks" are both labeled 6).
- The compaction request is sent with the header `x-stainless-helper: compaction`.
- Tool use is explicitly denied during compaction (`"Tool use is not allowed during compaction"`).
