The memory file has been verified and updated. Here's what the subagent found:

**File checked:** `/home/yeyito/Workspace/Agent/memory/modifying-agent-src.md`

### Verification Results (10 claims checked):

All referenced files, hooks, and aliases were verified against their actual sources (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `~/.zshrc`, `start.sh`, etc.).

### Changes made:

1. **Removed `refresh_pointers.py` from the description** — The file no longer exists in the project, and the call in `start.sh` is commented out.
2. **Added `hooks/validation-memories.sh` to the External References table** — This hook exists and is wired as a SessionStart hook in `settings.local.json` but was missing from the memory.
3. **Updated `reconcile_metadata.py` line reference from ~50 to ~44** — The actual call is on line 44 of `start.sh`.

Everything else was confirmed accurate and left untouched.

(The Lua diagnostics in the system reminder are unrelated to this task — they appear to be from a separate language server running in your editor.)
Done. Updated the first line of `/home/yeyito/Workspace/Agent/memory/modifying-agent-src.md`. Key improvements:

- Added explicit action verbs users might search for: "renaming", "moving", "deleting"
- Spelled out all five hook script names for better keyword matching
- Added "boot flow" as a synonym alongside "startup"
- Added "hooks wiring" and "keeping paths in sync" as concepts users might phrase queries around
- Kept it as a single plaintext line with no markdown formatting
