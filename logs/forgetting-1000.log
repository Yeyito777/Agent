**KEEP (appreciation +2)** — This memory contains a comprehensive, personalized email self-hosting plan with:

1. **User-specific constraints** (Cable Onda ISP blocking port 25, yeyito.dev domain details, 20-user requirement)
2. **Extensive provider research** with pricing calculated for their exact scale — 8 managed providers evaluated and rejected with specific reasoning
3. **Detailed VPS comparison** with provider-specific notes (e.g., Hetzner's port 25 unblock process)
4. **A concrete 9-step deployment plan** ready to execute
5. **Architecture and cost breakdown** tailored to their setup

This would take significant effort to reconstruct from scratch. The low score is simply due to recency (new memory, accessed once), not lack of value. Bumped by +2 given the density of hard-to-reconstruct research.
