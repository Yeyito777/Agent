# This file contains name proposals for different agent harnesses
- Kit
My personal assistant, lives on my computer, voice activated. Has skills and knowledge on how to operate my computer / help me out on my whims / quickies.

- Sage
Guardian or a keeper. Serene. In charge of cron jobs, that are sensitive: e.g. checking my email and telling me, checking my whatsapp, discord.... super conservative. Can reply if explicitly allowed / told to.

- Arc
This one feels electric. He should investigate things on his own end and propose ideas, maybe work on mock projects, show me things. Think of him like the "proactive" one. Can interact with Lynx.

- Halo
The "living system" that runs my life. A second "me", works on my todos, fixes things up, brings things to my attention that I should do. (This one seems really hard to engineer)

- Lynx
This one feels the most real. It should have a life of it's own, be it's own "entity", run its own todo's, work on its own projects, get things done on its end on its personal computer. I should be able to talk to it but not *force* it or *command* it to do anything the same way I can try to convince a friend or give him my opinions. He should be *real* not *sycophantic*. (This one seems hardest to engineer)

**Note for AI agents**: You do not need to modify this file it's mainly by and for humans.
