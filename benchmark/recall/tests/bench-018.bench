[prompt]
I want to add a new notification style to st that flashes red when an SSH session disconnects. Before I start coding, can you remind me how the notification system works and how to send a styled notification from a shell script? Also, I need to make sure my Right Shift autosuggestion binding still works after I rebuild.
