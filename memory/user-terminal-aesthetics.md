User's CLI/terminal visual style preferences (bold, gradients, ASCII art, branding)

# Principles
- **Bold over minimal**: Prefer big, impactful ASCII art over small one-liners
- **Multi-line presence**: Banners/branding should feel significant, take up space
- **Gradients**: Vertical color gradients using the ocean palette (see `user-terminal-color-scheme.md`)
- **Branding matters**: Tools should have visual identity, not just functional output

# Approved Examples

## KIT startup banner
6-line block letters with vertical gradient (lagoon aqua → aqua splash → seafoam teal):
```
██╗  ██╗██╗████████╗
██║ ██╔╝██║╚══██╔══╝
█████╔╝ ██║   ██║
██╔═██╗ ██║   ██║
██║  ██╗██║   ██║
╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝   ╚═╝
```

# When This Applies
- Script banners / splash screens
- CLI tool branding
- Startup messages
- Any "make it look nice" request for terminal output
