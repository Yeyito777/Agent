I'm looking to use my coding skills to engineer something that gets me money passively.
Thoroughly analyze the feasability of both ideas in playground/saas-deas. As a means of completing my goal. Analyze which one is more likely to get me to my goal.
Then come back with a veredict.

Imporant: Your veredict doesn't matter to me as much as the *WHY* behind it. Why is it feasable? Why not?
First go into plan mode so you can ask me some questions / iron any doubts out.
